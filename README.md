# HockeyAnalytics Project
A python based approach to getting, analyzing, and visualizing data from the NHL's API

## Usage
As of 1/5/2025, this project pulls the json from the NHL API and updates a local file. 

Currently only goalieSummary and goalieSavesByStrength are built in, but easy to modify or add as needed. There are plans to expand/modify built-in coverage in the future.
