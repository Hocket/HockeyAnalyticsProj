# HockeyAnalytics Project
A python based approach to getting, analyzing, and visualizing data from the NHL's API

## Usage
### __This is a work in progress project__

Usage will change drastically over time to reflect progress status.

- As of 1/5/2025, this project can pull the json from the NHL API and updates a local file. 

- As of 1/6/2025, this project can convert json from NHL API into a pandas dataframe

Currently only goalieSummary and goalieSavesByStrength are built in, but easy to modify or add as needed. There are plans to expand/modify built-in coverage in the future.
